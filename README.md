## 📚 What You'll Learn

This notebook covers the essential concepts every TensorFlow beginner should know:

1. ✅ **`tf.constant` vs `tf.Variable`**  
   - Grasp the difference between immutable constants and trainable variables.

2. 🔄 **Generating Random Tensors**  
   - Initialize tensors with randomness using `tf.random.normal()` and `tf.random.uniform()`.

3. 🔗 **Converting NumPy Arrays to Tensors**  
   - Effortlessly move data between NumPy and TensorFlow.

4. 🔍 **Indexing, Slicing & Reshaping Tensors**  
   - Master the art of slicing, indexing, and reshaping tensors for ML workflows.

5. ✖️ **Matrix Multiplication & Dot Product**  
   - Perform mathematical operations like `tf.matmul()` and `tf.tensordot()`.
